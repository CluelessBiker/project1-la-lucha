### Unfixed Bugs
The Social links appeared to be connected with a hyphen that would open one of the social platforms in a new tab. Could not understand what had occured. Have temporarily left the issue & will address it again later.
Fixed the issue by changing the display from "inline" to "inline-block".
Resolved the issue of the background image size within their containers using the {background-size:100% 100%;} rule found in Stackoverflow.

## Deployment
The repository was created on Github using the C.I. template. It was then pushed to Gitpod, where the initial layout was formed.
Spent a very long time frustrated wondering why my changes were not taking effect, and then realised that I had not linked my style.css to my index.html.
Next I worked on placing the hero image. I found that whilst I could easily set the dimensions of the container, I could not adjust the size of the photo within that container, & as a result, it was overly zoomed in. I removed the image from the style sheet, & added it to the html file instead. This assisted in fixing the size of the image, however it created a new problem in the styling, as the 'margin:0 auto;' was no longer centering the image. This was fixed by creating a 'margin-left:5%;'.
For now, there are scaling issues which will need to be addressed with the media queries, or possibly better style rules.
Decided the code was too complicated. I had guessed my way through acheiving the result I had wanted, & realised the method in which I got there was wrong. After reviewing what had occurred, I realised that I had not properly assigned my parent & child alterations to coincide with one another.
I'm still struggling with sizing the images within their containers, along with positioning the overlay text. I can control the positioning with percentages, but I would like to get them vertically aligned without it.
Leaving the issues with the home page for now, will need to seek guidance to resolve the matter.
Moving on to the 'Menu' page.

### Content
As my knowledge of implementation is limited at this point in my learning, the initial set up & style was set loosely on the 'Love Running' walk-through project. From there, I took inspitaion for the design of the navigation bar, along with the display of the social links in the footer element.
